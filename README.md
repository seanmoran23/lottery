# Rugby Team Assignment and Probability Calculator

This Python script is designed to assign rugby teams to participants randomly and calculate their probability of having a winning team based on implied probabilities from team odds.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pandas library (`pip install pandas`)

## Usage

1. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

2. Install the required Pandas library by running the following command:

```pip3 install pandas```

3. Run the script using the command:

```python3 rugby.py```

## Functionality

1. The script randomly assigns rugby teams to participants based on team ranks and the number of teams to assign per participant.

2. Implied probabilities are calculated based on team odds, and participant probabilities of having a winning team are calculated.

3. The assignments are displayed using emojis for each country team.

4. The script uses the Pandas library to create and manipulate DataFrames for better data organization.
